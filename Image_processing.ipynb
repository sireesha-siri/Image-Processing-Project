The goal is to develop a mechanism for helmet detection in real time using a live feed from the traffic camera. In this project, we proposed a mechanism for detection twowheeler riders without helmet by using YOLO V3 architecture of neural network. The results shows a positive steps toward automating the echallan process which can bring more awareness on the society towards traffic rules.

The goal is to develop a mechanism for helmet detection in real time using a live feed from the traffic camera. In this project, we proposed a mechanism for detection twowheeler riders without helmet by using YOLO V3 architecture of neural network. The results shows a positive steps toward automating the echallan process which can bring more awareness on the society towards traffic rules.
